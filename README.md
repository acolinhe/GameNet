# GameNet

GameNet is a personal project aimed at creating a knowledge graph of interconnected video games. 
The project utilizes Docker, Kubernetes, Go, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) to fetch and process data from the Wikipedia API, storing the results in a structured 
graph database.

## Introduction
GameNet aims to create a comprehensive knowledge graph that connects different video games 
based on information fetched from Wikipedia. This project involves data ingestion, NLP 
processing, and storing the processed data in a graph database for easy querying and analysis.

## Features
* Fetches data from the Wikipedia API
* Processes data using NLP techniques
* Stores data in PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases
* Utilizes Docker for containerization
* Deploys on Kubernetes for scalability

## Technologies
* **Go**: The main programming language for backend services
* **Docker**: For containerizing the application
* **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating the containers
* **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage
* **Neo4j**: For graph data storage
* **NLP**: For processing and extracting information from text
* **Wikipedia API**: For fetching video game data
